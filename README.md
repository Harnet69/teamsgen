# Teams generator
## What for
   As we perfectly know, it can be VERY difficult to divide members to teams. Someone wants to be with exact person, someone hate another. But for some reason, for education goals for example, you should divide members randomly.
   
   So go ahead and use this teams generator, which do all this hard and nervous work for you. And nobody can’t blame you for the choice.
